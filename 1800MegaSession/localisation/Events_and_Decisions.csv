NWCTIT10; Total collapse in Gran Colombia;x 
NWCDES10; Though we have secured our independence from the Spanish our state has found itself heading an administration stretched well beyond the breaking point. In the best of cases local leaders and administrations feel they've been left independent and have simply declared as such, at worst natives and savages have risen up, slaughtered their local administration and claimed land for themselves. This seems to be the total collapse of Gran Columbia as we know it.;x
NWCTIT11;President Philippe Henriques shot!;x 
NWCDES11;The beloved leader and gentle father of independent Peru has been dead by an unknown assassin in the early hours of the morning walking to the building site of the new congress building. A nearby policeman heard the shot and rushed to investigate, when he arrived the assassin was gone, leaving our dear president dead on the road. Theories on the assassins identity are spreading like wildfire, with some saying it was a Spanish loyalist trying to weaken Peru for a renewed Spanish Invasion or a native Aimaran hoping for his own peoples independence, one theory claims the gunman was a "Yankee agent". Regardless of who is truly responsible, the death of President Henriques has clearly shattered our nations Independence Day celebrations and left our citizens shaken. Vice President Vargas will have an uphill battle trying to calm the people.;x
NWCTIT12;Death and Anarchy in Peru;x 
NWCDES12;Though we have might have escaped from Spanish tyranny Peru has descended into total chaos after the assassination of President Henriques. The newly appointed President Vargas has totally failed to fill the void left by President Henriques, his weak handling of the growing crisis has only made Perus situation worse and as a result near total anarchy has consumed Peru with local governors attempting to minimise damage to themselves by breaking away from the central government and declaring independence. Having seemingly caused a total collapse, President Vargas has resigned from office without declaring a successor, sending the state into further decline. Without any formal leadership the Peruvian Congress is now scrambling to find someone who would actually be willing to lead Peru at this time. Let us hope the next President can re-unite Peru.;x
NWCTIT13;Breakdown of Buenos Aires;x 
NWCDES13;With independence secured from the Spanish the planes of Buenos Aires have descended into a sour state. With the war against the Spain over, the once unified people of the Horn have grown hostile and to distrust one another, with each local administration ignoring or refusing to acknowledge the central government. So as to save Buenos Aires from death by poor administration, the Central Government has granted independence to many local administrations with little regard of who is leading said administrations by the end of the process. To finalise this unprecedented move, half of the Buenos Aires congressmen have simply resigned and retired themselves to work on their farms. This strange turn of events has confused the international community.;x

form_united_maya_desc; With the former slaves of the North and the farmers of the South drawing closer together under our stewardship we feel that we finally have the ability to properly unite the Mayan people for the first time since the Spanish invaded all those centuries ago. Let North and South go forward onto the world stage as a united people.;x
