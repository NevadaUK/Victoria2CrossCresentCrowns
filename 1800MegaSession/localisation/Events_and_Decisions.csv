NWCTIT10; Total collapse in Gran Colombia;x 
NWCDES10; Though we have secured our independence from the Spanish our state has found itself heading an administration stretched well beyond the breaking point. In the best of cases local leaders and administrations feel they've been left independent and have simply declared as such, at worst natives and savages have risen up, slaughtered their local administration and claimed land for themselves. This seems to be the total collapse of Gran Columbia as we know it.;x
NWCTIT11;President Philippe Henriques shot!;x 
NWCDES11;The beloved leader and gentle father of independent Peru was shot through the neck by an unknown assailant in the early hours of the morning while he was on his way to the building site of the new congress building. A nearby policeman heard the shot and rushed to investigate, when he arrived the gunman had already fled, leaving our dear president dead on the road. Theories on the gunman are already spreading like wildfire, with some saying it was a Spanish loyalist trying to weaken Peru for a renewed Spanish Invasion or a native Aimara hoping for his own peoples independence, some have dared to blame Vice President Ricardo Vargas. Regardless of who is truly responsible, the death of President Henriques has clearly shattered our nations Independence Day celebrations and left our citizens shaken. We can only hope that this doesn't destroy the future of our young nation.;x
NWCTIT12;Death and Anarchy in Peru;x 
NWCDES12;Though we have might have escaped from Spanish tyranny Peru has descended into total chaos after the assassination of President Philippe Henriques. The newly appointed President Vargas has failed to fill the gap left by President Henriques, as a result anarchy has consumed Peru with local governors breaking away from the central government and declaring independence. With seemingly a total collapse on his hands, President Vargas has resigned from office without declaring who will be his successor. Without any formal leadership the Peruvian Congress is now scrambling to find someone who's actually willing to lead Peru. Sadly it seems to be far too late for someone to pull Peru back together however time will have to show us what this cruel world shall throw at us.;x
