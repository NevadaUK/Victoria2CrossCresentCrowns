NWCTIT11;President Philippe Henriques shot!;x , when he arrived the gunman had already fled, leaving our dear president dead on the road. Theories on the gunman are already spreading like wildfire, with some saying it was a Spanish loyalist trying to weaken Peru for a renewed Spanish Invasion or a native Aimara hoping for his own peoples independence, some have dared to blame Vice President Ricardo Vargas. Regardless of who is truly responsible, the death of President Henriques has clearly shattered our nations Independence Day celebrations and left our citizens shaken. We can only hope that this doesn't destroy the future of our young nation.;x

NWCTIT12;Death and Anarchy in Peru;x , as a result anarchy has consumed Peru with local governors breaking away from the central government and declaring independence. With seemingly a total collapse on his hands, President Vargas has resigned from office without declaring who will be his successor. Without any formal leadership the Peruvian Congress is now scrambling to find someone who's actually willing to lead Peru. Sadly it seems to be far too late for someone to pull Peru back together however time will have to show us what this cruel world shall throw at us.;x,,,

INDTIT01;The Second Contiental Congress;x,,,
INDDES01;The Second Continental Congress was a meeting of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies in America which united in the American Revolutionary War. It convened on May 10, 1775 with representatives from 12 of the colonies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania shortly after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, succeeding the First Continental Congress which met in Philadelphia from September 5 to October 26, 1774. The Second Congress functioned as a de facto national government at the outset of the Revolutionary War by raising armies, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and writing petitions such as the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms and the Olive Branch Petition. All thirteen colonies were represented by the time that the Congress adopted the Lee Resolution which declared independence from Britain on July 2, 1776, and the congress agreed to the Declaration of Independence two days later.;x,,,
convention_USA_title;The Constitutional Convention;x,,,,,
convention_USA_desc;At the time, the convention was not referred to as a "Constitutional convention", nor did most of the delegates arrive intending to draft a new constitution. Many assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation, and would not have agreed to participate otherwise. Once the convention began, however, most of the delegates – though not all – came to agree in general terms that the goal would be a new system of government, not simply a revised version of the Articles of Confederation.;x",,,,,

INDDES02;Officially titled A Proclamation for Suppressing Rebellion and Sedition, was the response of George III to the news of the Battle of Bunker Hill at the outset of the American Revolution.

The 1775 proclamation of rebellion also encouraged subjects throughout the empire, including those in Britain, to report anyone carrying on "traitorous correspondence" with the rebels to be punished.;x,,,
